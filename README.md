Using Unity with git: http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TimPettersen/20161206/286981/The_complete_guide_to_Unity__Git.php

Must merge scene files manually.

Todo:
 + Change "story mode" to "Curbside" and "endless mode" to "Recycling Center"
 + Create additional assets to fit the theme
 + Refine and balance systems to better educate about recycling.
 + Look into Unity cloud build: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/cloud-build/creating-your-first-source-control-repository
