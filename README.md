# Trash Toss Recycling Game

A gaming app project implemented by Computer Science 115/116/117 students in collaboration with the IDEASS program.

Must use Unity 5.5.2p4, conveyor belt flickers otherwise. Different animation system might fix.

Using Unity with Git does not work well at all. Instead, use Unity Collab - version control that is included directly in Unity. Multiple people can collaborate on code and push to the master branch. Only downside is that you cannot go back to a previous state of the project after commiting. So make sure there are no bugs in the code before you add your changes to Unity Collab.



Todo:
 + Change "story mode" to "Curbside Tutorial" and "endless mode" to "Recycling Center"
 + Refine and balance systems to better educate about recycling.
